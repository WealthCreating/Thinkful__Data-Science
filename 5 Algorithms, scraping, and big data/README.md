# Other Topics in Data Science
---
Data science is a lot more than just machine learning. While those algorithms are a lot of fun and make up a lot of what makes data science powerful, there are many more things that you need to be familiar with in order to be effective.

In this unit we'll cover a variety of data science topics that wouldn't really be at home anywhere else in the course, but they are still extremely useful things to know about on the job. We'll cover a range of topics, from scraping to NLP to big data infrastructure. Because of the range of topics, these lessons will flow together a little less than normal, so be prepared to treat the lessons as much more distinct from those lessons immediately preceding or following them. These are also almost all gateway lessons. They are meant to introduce a topic that is hugely varied, not to cover every wrinkle of a topic. To implement a lot of this, like surveys or big data or scraping, you'll need to research more about the specific context you're working in, and how things are implemented will vary significantly from situation to situation.

There's a lot to get to, so let's get started.
