## Now that you're comfortable with the SQLite database we provided for you, try spinning up your own. Let's use this data set from Airbnb. Pick a city and download the CSV's for that city. The SQLite browser has an import function for CSV's under the File menu.  Once you have your database set up, run some queries to start understanding your city's Airbnb's. Here are some questions you should try to answer:

---
#### What's the most expensive listing?  What else can you tell me about the listing?

#### What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

#### What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city?  What about the busiest?
