Data and analysis - data science for investigations
---
The data science process often begins with asking a simple question: What is happening?

It may sound overly simple, but trying to gain an understanding of the status quo and find data science's role within that reality is an essential starting point. Before any modeling or prediction can be done, a data scientist has to investigate using the data and tools available. This unit addresses that process.

We'll cover a variety of topics in this unit, starting with how to ask questions like a data scientist and what kind of questions a data scientist could answer. Next will be data accessing and aggregation with the querying language SQL, a key way of gathering data. Then we'll cover intermediate data visualization with an emphasis on data cleaning. Lastly we'll cover experimentation, a key way of using data to ask and answer questions.

Let's get started!
