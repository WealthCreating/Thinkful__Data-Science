# Unsupervised learning - Venturing into the unknown

---

This unit will contain a mixture of classic and cutting edge techniques, covering clustering and neural networks as well as a bit of NLP (natural language processing).
  Throughout the unit we'll use some supervised techniques whose frameworks we can transform into unsupervised techniques, as well as some specialized unsupervised techniques.
