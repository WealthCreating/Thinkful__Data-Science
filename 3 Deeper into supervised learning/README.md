# Deeper into supervised learning

---


Now that you've been introduced to some of the key concepts of supervised learning, we can go a little deeper.

In this Unit you'll learn some of the essential techniques of data science today. These will be the tools you'll use day to day when crafting models. We'll build on some of the concepts we've already introduced to create more complex and accurate models useful in a variety of situations, each with their own logic, strengths, and weaknesses.

Make sure you experiment with these models and thoroughly understand the ways you can manipulate them. We'll cover the essentials, but nothing replaces trying something to see what happens. There are infinite possibilities and surely just as many surprises waiting along the way.
